This project implements a Warehouse Management System API using Flask and Cassandra to manage warehouses and product inventories. The API allows users to register and manage warehouses, as well as manage the inventory of products in each warehouse. The data is stored in Cassandra, a distributed NoSQL database, and the API provides various endpoints to interact with this data.
